# memoryGameForMotorola

My name is Sebastian, I am studying at the AGH University of Science and Technology in Cracow in the field of Education in Technology and Computer Science.
I like programming and spending time on solving programming problems, it gives me great pleasure.
I would like to work as a programmer in the future because I think I would feel good in this profession. 
I started to be interested in programming already in technical school, I would like to develop my skills in this field.
